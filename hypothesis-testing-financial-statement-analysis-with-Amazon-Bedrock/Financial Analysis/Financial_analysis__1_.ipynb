      "   - The company has a reasonable operating profit margin (Operating ROA of 13.3%) and a moderate net profit margin (ROA of 9.3%), indicating moderate profitability from its assets.\n",
      "   - The return on total capital (12.8%) and return on equity (16.5%) suggest a reasonable level of profitability from the company's capital and shareholders' equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Leverage Ratios:\n",
      "   - The company has a moderate level of leverage, with a debt-to-assets ratio of 40%, a debt-to-capital ratio of 41.4%, and a debt-to-equity ratio of 70.6%.\n",
      "   - The financial leverage ratio of 1.765 indicates a moderate level of financial leverage, with $1.765 in assets for every $1 of shareholders' equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Limitations:\n",
      "   - Due to the lack of specific information, it was not possible to calculate or interpret valuation ratios, dividend-related ratios, solvency ratios, price per share ratios, segment ratios, or performance ratios related to cash flows, interest payments, taxes, dividends, and capital expenditures.\n",
      "   - The analysis was limited to the information provided in the basic financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement), without additional details on share capital structure, dividend payments, interest expenses, segmented data, or cash flow components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Takeaway:\n",
      "The company appears to have moderate profitability and a moderate level of leverage based on the available information. However, a more comprehensive analysis was hindered by the lack of specific data points related to valuation, dividends, solvency, segment performance, and cash flow components. Additional information would be required to provide a more detailed assessment of the company's financial performance and position.\n"
